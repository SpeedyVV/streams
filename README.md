# streams

Tutorial of Stream listener and streamController “talking” asynchronously without plugins
## Getting Started

This project is "Step 2" starting point for a Flutter application .

As an old timer that has not coded for 30 years, this experience of learning Dart/Flutter has been difficult.

I thought the template project - in Android Studiowas - useless for learning.

But after 6 months of watching dozens of videos, purchasing online courses, and reading the endless (of what I consider poor, and inconsistant on updates) documentation, I decided to try and build a real project from this template.

"But I'm trying. I'm trying REAL hard, Ringo!"
